# Truth Checker Project Analysis

## Executive Summary

This document outlines our analysis for developing an AI agent capable of real-time fact-checking through audio processing. The system will listen to speech, transcribe it using Deepgram API, verify claims against reliable databases and sources, and provide immediate feedback on whether statements are true or false, along with explanations and sources.

## Market Analysis

### Existing Fact-Checking Solutions

Several fact-checking solutions already exist in the market:

1. **PolitiFact**: Uses a Truth-o-Meter for political claims with an extensive database
2. **Snopes**: One of the oldest fact-checking websites covering a wide range of topics
3. **FactCheck.org**: Operated by the Annenberg Public Policy Center, focuses on U.S. political statements
4. **Google Fact Check Explorer**: Aggregates claims and fact-checks from various sources
5. **Full Fact**: UK-based automated tool that flags false claims in real-time
6. **ClaimBuster**: Scans texts to identify statements needing verification
7. **Originality.AI**: Comprehensive AI-powered fact-checking system
8. **FactMata**: Uses machine learning to analyze online content truthfulness
9. **Factiverse**: Research-based AI fact-checking tools for maintaining credibility

Most of these solutions focus on text-based fact-checking, and few offer real-time audio monitoring capabilities. This presents an opportunity for our system to fill a gap in the market.

## Technical Architecture

Our system is implementing a **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** architecture combined with elements of **Hexagonal Architecture** to ensure modularity and maintainability.

### Current Implementation Status

1. **Speech-to-Text Integration (Completed)**:
   - âœ… Successfully integrated Deepgram API for real-time audio transcription
   - âœ… Implemented HTTP and WebSocket interfaces for different use cases
   - âœ… Created mock mode for development without consuming API credits
   - âœ… Added support for multiple audio formats and streaming options

2. **API Layer (Partially Completed)**:
   - âœ… Developed RESTful endpoints for file-based transcription
   - âœ… Implemented WebSocket for real-time audio streaming
   - âœ… Created robust error handling and logging
   - ðŸ”„ Working on authentication and rate limiting

3. **Architecture Foundation (Completed)**:
   - âœ… Implemented hexagonal architecture with clear separation of:
     - Domain layer: Core models and interfaces
     - Application layer: Services coordinating business logic
     - Infrastructure layer: External service integrations
     - Interfaces layer: API endpoints and CLI

### RAG Architecture Components (Planned)

1. **Retrieval Process**:
   - When receiving a query, the system searches external knowledge bases for relevant information
   - Uses advanced retrieval algorithms like semantic search or dense vector retrieval

2. **RAG Core Components**:
   - **Encoder**: Converts input queries into vector representations
   - **Retriever**: Searches knowledge bases using the encoded query
   - **Generator**: Creates final responses using retrieved information

3. **Enhancements**:
   - **Adaptive RAG**: Implements a router for directing questions to different retrieval approaches
   - **Corrective RAG**: Provides fallback mechanisms when retrieved context is irrelevant
   - **Self-RAG**: Includes a hallucination grader to fix answers that hallucinate or don't address questions

## Conclusion

The Truth Checker project has successfully completed the first phase of development with the implementation of the Deepgram transcription service. The system now provides robust real-time speech-to-text capabilities through both HTTP endpoints and WebSocket connections.

The hexagonal architecture approach has proven effective, allowing clean separation between the core business logic and external services. This architecture will continue to provide benefits as we implement additional components like the RAG system for fact-checking.

The next phase will focus on claim detection and knowledge base development, moving us closer to the goal of real-time audio fact-checking capabilities.
