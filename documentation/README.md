## Project Structure

The Truth Checker project follows a hexagonal architecture (ports and adapters) with the following high-level structure:

```
truth_checker/
â”œâ”€â”€ domain/           # Core business logic and entity models
â”œâ”€â”€ application/      # Use cases and application services
â”œâ”€â”€ infrastructure/   # External services and adapters
â”œâ”€â”€ interfaces/       # User interfaces and API endpoints
```
