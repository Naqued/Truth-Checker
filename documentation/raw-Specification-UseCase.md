# Truth Checker Project Development Handbook

## Project Overview

We are developing an AI agent that can listen to audio in real-time, transcribe it using the Deepgram API, and check the factual accuracy of claims against reliable databases, scientific sources, and trusted fact-checkers. The system will display results on screen, indicating whether statements are true or false, along with explanations and sources.

This document tracks our development progress, tasks, and implementation details.

## Project Goals

1. Build a real-time audio fact-checking system
2. Implement Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture
3. Follow hexagonal architecture principles for maintainability
4. Create a modular system with separate backend and client components
5. Deliver accurate fact-checking with minimal latency

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Backend Infrastructure

#### 1.1 Deepgram STT Integration (âœ… Completed)

- âœ… Set up Python environment and dependencies
- âœ… Implement real-time audio streaming to Deepgram API
- âœ… Process and parse transcription responses
- âœ… Handle connection events (open, close, transcript, metadata, error)
- âœ… Test with sample audio streams

**Technical Notes:**
- Successfully integrated the Deepgram Python SDK for audio streaming
- Implemented robust error handling for network issues and API key validation
- Added support for multiple audio formats (MP3, WAV, WebM, OGG, FLAC, PCM)
- Implemented a mock mode for development without consuming API credits
- Used HTTP endpoint for file upload and WebSocket for real-time streaming
- Created queuing system for handling transcripts across threads
- Implemented proper cleanup of resources when connections close

**Implementation Approach:**
```
âœ… Installed Deepgram SDK and dependencies
âœ… Created connection to Deepgram API using API key from environment variables
âœ… Set up streaming connection with parameters (model=nova-2, language=en-US, smart_format=true)
âœ… Implemented event handlers for the streaming connection
âœ… Processed audio input and sent to Deepgram
âœ… Parsed and processed transcription responses
```

#### 1.2 Claim Detection System (Not Started)

- Develop algorithm to identify verifiable claims in transcribed text
- Separate opinions from factual statements
- Implement context tracking to understand related statements
- Create prioritization mechanism for claim verification

#### 1.3 RAG Architecture Implementation (Not Started)

- Set up vector database (ChromaDB) for knowledge storage
- Implement document retrieval system
- Create embedding pipeline for knowledge base
- Implement query routing system (Adaptive RAG)
- Build fallback mechanisms (Corrective RAG)
- Develop hallucination detection (Self-RAG)

### Phase 2: Fact-Checking Core

#### 2.1 Knowledge Base Integration (Not Started)

- Integrate external fact-checking databases
- Implement web search capabilities
- Set up scientific database connections
- Design source reliability scoring system
- Create knowledge retrieval API

#### 2.2 Fact Verification Engine (Not Started)

- Develop claim matching algorithm
- Implement confidence scoring system
- Create explanation generation mechanism
- Design source attribution system
- Build response formatting system

### Phase 3: Client Development

#### 3.1 API Layer (Partially Completed)

- âœ… Design RESTful API endpoints
- âœ… Implement WebSocket for real-time updates
- Create authentication system
- Develop rate limiting and caching
- Build error handling middleware

#### 3.2 Client Application (Not Started)

- Design user interface for displaying results
- Implement audio capture functionality
- Create visualization for fact-checking results
- Develop user settings and preferences
- Build export and sharing capabilities

## Current Progress

- âœ… Completed project analysis and architecture design
- âœ… Implemented Deepgram as our STT solution with real-time transcription
- âœ… Created HTTP and WebSocket endpoints for audio processing
- âœ… Developed mock mode for testing without API credits
- âœ… Integrated audio file processing for various formats
- ðŸ”„ Working on claim detection algorithm
- ðŸ”„ Planning RAG architecture implementation

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Set up development environment
2. âœ… Implement basic Deepgram integration
3. âœ… Test audio streaming capabilities
4. Begin building claim detection algorithm
5. Design initial database schema for knowledge base

## Technical Decisions

### Speech-to-Text: Deepgram

We selected Deepgram for STT because:
- âœ… Excellent real-time transcription capabilities
- âœ… Support for streaming audio with WebSocket
- âœ… High accuracy with the Nova-2 model
- âœ… Robust SDK support for Python
- âœ… Smart formatting features for improved readability

**Implementation Insights:**
- API key should be stored in a `.env` file at the project root
- WebSocket connection requires proper event handling for transcripts
- Error handling needs to account for network issues and API limits
- Mock mode is essential for development without consuming API credits

### RAG Implementation: LangChain + LangGraph

We'll use LangChain and LangGraph because:
- LangChain provides excellent tools for building RAG systems
- LangGraph enables cyclical computational capabilities
- Both integrate well with vector databases
- Support for advanced RAG techniques (Adaptive, Corrective, Self-RAG)
- Active community and ongoing development

### Database: ChromaDB

ChromaDB was selected because:
- Open-source vector database
- Good performance for semantic search
- Easy integration with Python
- Supports embeddings from various models
- Lightweight deployment options
